Post WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 Discussion: Cody Rhodes answers The Rock's invitation to surrender his soul

The latest WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 event sent shockwaves through the wrestling community as Cody Rhodes finally addressed The Rock's controversial challenge from last week. The American Nightmare stood in the center of the ring, microphone in hand, as he contemplated The Final Boss's ultimatum to surrender his soul or face consequences at WrestleMania.

Rhodes, visibly emotional yet resolute, reminded the audience of his journey - the years away from WWE, his triumphant return, and his promise to finish the story. "The Rock wants me to surrender my soul," Rhodes said, his voice unwavering. "But my soul belongs to this ring, to this company, to my family's legacy, and to each and every one of you."

The crowd erupted as Rhodes declared that not only would he refuse to surrender, but he would meet The Rock's challenge head-on at WrestleMania, putting everything on the line. "If The Final Boss wants a war, then The American Nightmare is ready to give him one he'll never forget," Rhodes proclaimed to thunderous applause.

Meanwhile, Roman Reigns watched the segment from backstage, his expression unreadable as the alliance between him and The Rock continues to raise questions. Will the Tribal Chief get involved in this deeply personal feud, or will he allow The Rock and Rhodes to settle their differences one-on-one?

As WrestleMania approaches, the wrestling world awaits what promises to be an epic confrontation between two of the industry's biggest stars, with much more than championship gold at stake.
